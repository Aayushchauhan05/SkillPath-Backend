# Backend Repository - Express.js Application  

## 🌟 Project Overview  

This repository contains the backend code for a robust Express.js application designed for scalability and integration with modern technologies. It is organized to ensure modularity, maintainability, and ease of navigation. The application handles core business logic, data storage, external API integrations, and middleware for seamless user interactions.

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Framework**: Built using **Express.js**, a fast and minimal web framework for Node.js.
- **Database**: Utilizes **MongoDB** for efficient and flexible data storage.
- **System Design**: Implements **Object-Oriented System Design (OOSD)** principles for modular, reusable, and easy-to-maintain code.
- **Google API Integration**: Integrates **Google Calendar API** for event management and scheduling.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for logging, authentication, error handling, and validation.
- **RESTful API**: Clean and robust APIs for frontend and third-party integration.
- **Security**: Secure authentication with **JWT** and error handling mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

1. **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
2. **Express.js**: Web framework for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests.
3. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, scalable manner.
4. **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to simplify database operations.
5. **Google APIs**: Integration with Google Calendar API for scheduling and event management.
6. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
7. **Dotenv**: Manages environment variables for secure configuration handling.

## 🖥️ Local Development Setup  

### Prerequisites  
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (either local or cloud-based)
- **Google Cloud Console** credentials for API integration

### Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Copy the contents of `.env.example` and update values for the following:
     - MongoDB URI
     - Google API credentials (client ID, client secret, etc.)

4. **Start MongoDB**:
   Ensure your MongoDB server is running locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB instance like MongoDB Atlas.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or for development mode with hot-reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛡️ Error Handling  

The backend includes comprehensive error handling for various issues such as invalid user input, database connectivity problems, and unauthorized access. Errors are managed through a custom `Error` module, which standardizes error responses across the application.
